# Memorandum-Pizza-Company
A memorandum which proposes a research question to the CEO of a pizza company about their strength compared to their competitor. The result of this could be used for their upcoming marketing advertisement.
##
You have been hired as a consultant by a small pizza company (create a name for this small pizza company). They want your help to design a study to collect and summarize appropriate data that might be used in a marketing advertisement. They want to highlight a strength of their small pizza company as compared to their main competitor pizza company (create a name for this competitor too).

You are asked to prepare a memorandum to the small pizza company’s CEO describing how they might conduct such a study. Your memo should include (1) the proposed research question, (2) the variable(s) that would be recorded (what you would measure and how you would measure it), and (3) how you would summarize the data (which graphical and/or numerical summaries you would report).

For example: Suppose the small pizza company, ABC Pizza, believes that they are particularly good at serving their customers quickly once a pizza order is placed, as compared to their competitor, XYZ Pizza. The research question might be: Is the average service time for ABC Pizza customers less than that for XYZ Pizza customers? The study might involve recording service times for a sample of 30 ABC customers and service times for a sample of 30 XYZ customers. You would need to include how service time will be recorded (e.g. measured from the time the order is placed to when the pizza is delivered to the table, in minutes; perhaps making sure measurements are collected over similar days/time frames). Since this definition of service time is a quantitative measure, you might recommend creating side by side boxplots of the service times (one for ABC and one for XYZ), and you might also plan to report the average service times for each company along with standard deviations, to help assess which company is better (lower) and how consistent the service times are.

Determine what will be your pizza company’s strength. Do not select service time as measured in the previous example. Perhaps it could be about cost, or something regarding pizza ingredients/toppings/options, or it could focus around customer satisfaction, etc. Be creative! This step will help you form your proposed research question.

Then, determine your proposed research question. The question should align with the strength of your company and the answer to this question should be able to be used to make the company stand out from the competition in its upcoming advertisement.

Next, determine what data you would need to collect to help answer the research question and describe how you will collect/measure that data.

Then, based on the type of data that would be collected, determine what graphical and/or numerical summaries would be appropriate to help answer your research question.

Finally, draft your memorandum for the small pizza company’s CEO, who has the basic statistical literacy needed for reviewing your written study proposal. You should not include your name on the assignment (to keep the peer review anonymous). 

Your memorandum is expected to be between 350-500 words (excluding header, footer). If you need a review of what memorandum (or, "memo") format looks like, here are some references:

After your draft is complete, give it a final proofread/review.
